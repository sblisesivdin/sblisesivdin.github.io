Two years ago, I wrote a project about building UV-VIS-NIR spectrometer, and it was financially supported by TUBITAK. It was one of the 146 successful projects of initially submitted 3323 entrepreneurial business ideas to TUBITAK in that term. Biarsis Ltd was founded with this project.

We successfully completed our project with 4 products: Argus 1000 and Argus 1200 Spectrometers, Dragon Tungsten-Halogen Light Source and IRIS Spectral Acquisition and Analysis Software. With this project, I was accepted to participate a fellowship program of Royal Academy of Engineering which is called “Leaders in Innovation fellowship”. This program is funded by the Ministry of Labor, Energy and Industrial Strategy of the United Kingdom's Newton Fund (known as Katip Celebi Fund in Turkey) and directed by the Royal Academy of Engineering of United Kingdom. For the second year, we have started MOCA Software Project. In the time of writing this post, MOCA is nearly finished. We have many good project plans for building different types of scientific equipment and software. However, there is more about the Biarsis Ltd.

During the last year, we have acquisition/merger negotiations with the one of the biggest scientific equipment supplier of Turkey. They also have sophisticated research & development facilities and culture in their company, and they are interested in to extend their product range, and buying the know-how in products of Biarsis.

Our negotiations have ended at the beginning of September 2020, and here I want to announce that acquisition of Biarsis Ltd. is completed. As a previous CEO of Biarsis, I am very happy about the acquisition. With this acquisition, Biarsis is now backed by strong cash-flow, work-force and experienced executives. For me, I have no longer a shareholder of Biarsis, but I will continue my studies as an academic consult for the company, and I will happily to work as technical manager in future projects of Biarsis. Therefore, I am now totally free of the executive work and can focus on technical issues that I love to deal with.

This is a total "win-win" for every party involved in the acquisition and also for the company. I am seeing a bright future for Biarsis. Thank you to all our past customers, our past employees for their support to Biarsis. Please be in contact for the future changes in Biarsis.
