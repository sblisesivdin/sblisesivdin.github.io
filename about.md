### About

<img align="left" src="files/Bora_Lisesivdin-251x300-150x150.jpg"> I was graduated from Hacettepe University, Department of Physics Engineering in 2003. Then, I completed my master of science studies about electron and magnetotransport properties of AlGaAs/GaAs and InGaAs/GaAs semiconductor structures grown by MBE at Gazi University Department of Advanced Technologies in 2005. Same year I started my doctorate studies at Department of Physics of same university. I went to University of Essex (UK) as a research student with a TUBITAK scholarship for a 6 months period (2007/2008). I completed my PhD studies about electron and magnetotransport properties, scattering properties of 2D electrons and hot electron transport of AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures grown by MOCVD in 2008. I worked as a postdoc at Bilkent University, Nanotechnology Research Center between 2008-2009. I started to work at Gazi University in 2009. I went to University of Essex (UK) as a visiting researcher with a TUBITAK scholarship for a 6 months period (2013). I am still working as a full professor at Gazi University, Department of Physics. As April 2018, I have more than 60 SCI articles and 60 proceedings in my field. I have one son (Deha Anıl Lişesivdin).
