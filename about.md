### About
I was graduated from Hacettepe University, Department of Physics Engineering in 2003. Then, I completed my master of science studies about electron and magnetotransport properties of AlGaAs/GaAs and InGaAs/GaAs semiconductor structures grown by MBE at Gazi University Department of Advanced Technologies in 2005. Same year I started my doctorate studies at Department of Physics of same university. I went to University of Essex (UK) as a research student with a TUBITAK scholarship for a 6 months period (2007/2008). I completed my PhD studies about electron and magnetotransport properties, scattering properties of 2D electrons and hot electron transport of AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures grown by MOCVD in 2008. I worked as a postdoc at Bilkent University, Nanotechnology Research Center between December 2008 and September 2009. I am continuing my studies firstly as an assistant professor then as an associate professor at Gazi University, Department of Physics, Nanoscale Devices and Carrier Transport Group since September 2009. I went to University of Essex (UK) as a visiting researcher with a TUBITAK scholarship for a 6 months period (2013). As March 2013, I have more than 40 SCI articles and 38 proceedings in my field. I have one son (Deha Anıl Lişesivdin).
