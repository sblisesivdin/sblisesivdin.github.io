### About

He was graduated from Hacettepe University, Department of Physics Engineering in 2003. Then, he completed his M.Sc. studies about electron and magnetotransport properties of AlGaAs/GaAs and InGaAs/GaAs heterostructures at Gazi University, Advanced Technologies Deparment in 2005. He went to University of Essex (UK) as a visiting research student with for 6 months. He completed his PhD studies about electron and magnetotransport properties, scattering properties of 2D electrons and hot electron transport of AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures grown by MOCVD in 2008. He worked as a postdoc at Bilkent University, Nanotechnology Research Center between 2008-2009. He started to work at Gazi University in 2009 as a faculty member. He went to University of Essex (UK) and Universtät Ulm (Germany) as a visiting researcher in 2013 and 2019, respectively. He is still working as a full professor at Gazi University, Physics Department. As of October 2019, he has more than 67 SCI articles and 80 proceedings in his field. He is married and he has one son (Deha Anıl Lişesivdin).
